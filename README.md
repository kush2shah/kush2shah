### Hi! 
I'm a Sophomore at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill studying Computer Science and Business Administration.

I know how to code in
- Java
- Python
- C

I also work as a climbing coach for the nation's 9th best climbing team, and will be working at Cisco Systems as a marketing intern this summer.
